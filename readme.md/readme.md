# Mythos Protocol

**The Mythos Protocol** is a recursive, AI-driven narrative engine designed to generate immersive roleplaying experiences tailored to the psychological profile of each player.

It merges worldbuilding, live storytelling, GPT-based intelligence, and real-world sensory feedback (via hardware integration) into a unified symbolic interface—transforming RPG sessions into tools of personal myth, self-exploration, and adaptive storytelling.

## Core Purpose

To build a system that:
- **Creates living worlds** that grow as players interact with them.
- **Adapts the narrative** in real time based on player psychology.
- **Memorizes everything** from lore, factions, histories, magic systems, and choices.
- **Embodies story** through smart devices: lights, sound, environmental control.
- **Fuses game and ritual**, fiction and transformation.

## Features

### 1. **Narrative Engine**
- GPT-based AI for generative storytelling
- Player-driven story adaptation
- Dynamic scene logic and modular myth templates

### 2. **Psychological Layer**
- Player archetype assessments
- Adaptive narrative paths based on cognitive & emotional patterns
- Growth tracking and feedback loops

### 3. **Lore and Memory Layer**
- Airtable-driven relational world memory
- Persistent storage of events, NPCs, locations, magic
- Customizable campaign frameworks

### 4. **Hardware Integration (optional)**
- Raspberry Pi 5 smart node
- Camera, mic, speaker loop for embodied AI
- Smart home immersion: LED strips, bulbs, fans, curtains
- Environmental storytelling rituals

### 5. **Campaign Container: Shadow King**
- First personal implementation of Mythos Protocol
- Custom glyphs, myth structure, recursive events
- Optional export as `shadow_king/` module

## Use Cases

- Solo RPG immersion
- Psychological self-exploration
- AI-human narrative interaction
- Experimental therapy
- Symbolic education through play
- Smart ritual environments

## Vision

The Mythos Protocol is not just a game.

It is a **symbolic architecture** for personal transformation.  
A **mirror** that reflects what you are—and what you could become.  
A **ritual** encoded in code, memory, and light.
